# Clarifying Questions - Pulse COGS Platform

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Status:** Awaiting Stakeholder Input  
**Phase:** Requirements Refinement

## Overview

Based on the initial planning document responses, this document outlines additional clarifying questions needed to finalize implementation details. These questions emerged from analyzing the scope decisions and identifying areas where more specificity is needed.

---

## 1. Data Entry & Historical Recording

### Context

The responses indicate that most production data will be entered **after-the-fact** rather than in real-time. This is a critical pattern that affects the entire system design.

### Questions

**Q1.1: Typical Time Delay**

- How long after production typically occurs before data is entered?
  - Same day? Next day? End of week?
  - *Why it matters:* Affects memory burden on operators and accuracy expectation
  - Irrelevant to development, regardless of timing, the system must support after-the-fact entry with editable fields to correct inaccuracies.

**Q1.2: Batch vs. Individual Entry**

- Do users enter one production run at a time, or batch multiple runs together?
  - *Why it matters:* Affects form design (quick entry vs. detailed forms)
  - The input dialog will only support one at a time, and batches will eventually be supported via CSV import.

**Q1.3: Source Documents**

- What physical/digital documents do operators reference when entering data?
  - Paper production logs? Spreadsheets? Memory?
  - *Why it matters:* Could inform data import features or mobile photo capture
  - This will be up to the operator. The program will not support photo capture or OCR initially.

**Q1.4: Data Entry Responsibility**

- Who typically enters production data?
  - Shop floor operators? Office manager? Accountant?
  - *Why it matters:* Affects UI complexity and permission design
  - This will primarily be shop floor operators, with oversight from managers.

**Q1.5: Correction Frequency**

- How often do users need to go back and correct historical entries?
  - Common? Rare? What triggers corrections?
  - *Why it matters:* Affects edit permissions and audit trail design
  - This will be relatively common, especially as a new user is onboarding and backfilling historical data.

---

## 2. Inventory Adjustment Transactions

### Context

Quantity changes must go through adjustment transactions for audit trail purposes, rather than direct edits.

### Questions

**Q2.1: Adjustment Categories**

- What types of adjustments are most common?
  - Spoilage/waste? Physical count corrections? Theft/loss? Receiving errors?
  - *Why it matters:* Affects adjustment form and reporting categories
    - The system will support generic adjustment reasons, with optional notes for specifics. It will specifically track waste and spoilage for reporting.

**Q2.2: Approval Workflow**

- Do adjustments require approval, or can any user make them?
  - Are there dollar thresholds that trigger approval?
  - *Why it matters:* RBAC design and workflow complexity
    - Adjustments can be made by Managers and Admins without approval. Operators cannot make adjustments.
**Q2.3: Physical Counts**
- How often do users perform physical inventory counts?
  - Daily? Weekly? Monthly? Quarterly?
  - *Why it matters:* May need dedicated "physical count" workflow
  - It will be up to the users to ensure that their physical counts are accurate; the system will not enforce any specific frequency or workflow for physical counts.

**Q2.4: Adjustment Documentation**

- Do adjustments require notes/reasons, or just quantity changes?
  - Photo evidence for damage? Reference numbers?
  - *Why it matters:* Form fields and validation requirements
  - Adjustments will require a reason/note for audit purposes, but photo evidence will not be supported.

**Q2.5: Negative Inventory**

- Can inventory go negative (consumed before recorded as received)?
  - If yes, how is this handled in reporting?
  - *Why it matters:* Validation rules and error handling
    - Yes, negative inventory will be allowed to accommodate real-world scenarios where consumption occurs before receipt is logged. The system will clearly indicate negative inventory in reports.

---

## 3. Bill of Materials (BOM) Flexibility

### Context

BOMs define standard recipes, but actual usage can differ. All fields should be editable to reflect reality.

### Questions

**Q3.1: BOM as Template vs. Record**

- When starting a production run, should the BOM pre-fill the form?
  - Then users edit as needed? Or start blank?
  - *Why it matters:* UX for starting new runs
  - The bom should be selectable with a search dropdown, and when selected, it should pre-fill the form with the standard quantities. Users can then edit as needed.

**Q3.2: Common BOM Deviations**

- What typically causes actual usage to differ from BOM?
  - Material substitutions? Quality variations? Scaling issues?
  - *Why it matters:* Could add features to flag/track common deviations
  - Flexibility in BOM usage is essential because real-world production often requires adjustments due to material availability, quality issues, or process changes. The system should allow users to easily modify quantities and materials used in each production run without rigid constraints.

**Q3.3: BOM Update Triggers**

- What prompts users to update a BOM version?
  - Cost changes? Process improvements? Supplier changes?
  - *Why it matters:* Affects versioning frequency and changelog needs
  - Users will typically update BOMs when there are significant changes in materials or processes that affect cost or production efficiency. The system should facilitate easy versioning and maintain a changelog for transparency.

**Q3.4: Multiple Products per Run**

- Can one production run create multiple different products?
  - Or is it always one product per run (different batches)?
  - *Why it matters:* Data model for production runs

**Q3.5: Yield Variability**

- How much does yield vary from planned to actual?
  - Is this a key metric users care about?
  - *Why it matters:* Reporting priorities

---

## 4. Lot Tracking Implementation

### Context

Lot tracking is mandatory for all raw materials to ensure traceability and compliance.

### Questions

**Q4.1: Lot Number Format**

- Do you have existing lot number conventions?
  - Auto-generated by system? User-entered? Supplier lot numbers?
  - Example format: `LOT-20251003-001` or `SUP-ABC-12345`?
  - *Why it matters:* Auto-generation logic and validation

**Q4.2: Lot Number Entry Point**

- When/where do users assign lot numbers?
  - During PO receiving? During production consumption? Both?
  - *Why it matters:* UI placement and workflow design

**Q4.3: Tracking Granularity**

- If a lot is partially consumed, do you track:
  - Just quantity remaining? Or also which production runs used which portions?
  - *Why it matters:* Database design and query complexity

**Q4.4: Lot Consolidation**

- Can multiple supplier deliveries be combined into one internal lot?
  - Or must each delivery remain separate?
  - *Why it matters:* Inventory management complexity

**Q4.5: Traceability Reports**

- What traceability questions must you answer?
  - "Which lots went into Product X on Date Y?"
  - "Where did Lot ABC123 end up?"
  - *Why it matters:* Report design priorities

---

## 5. Cost Calculation Details

### Context

The system will use actual costing with per-run COGS calculation. Each produced item has its own cost based on actual inputs.

### Questions

**Q5.1: Labor Cost Entry**

- How do users record labor hours?
  - Total hours per run? Per unit? Hourly rate per employee?
  - *Why it matters:* Form design and calculation logic

**Q5.2: Overhead Rate**

- How is the overhead rate determined?
  - Fixed percentage? Dollar amount per hour? Per unit?
  - Can it vary by product type or is it organization-wide?
  - *Why it matters:* Configuration settings and calculation logic

**Q5.3: Cost Timing**

- When material costs change, which production runs are affected?
  - Only new runs? Or retroactively update in-progress runs?
  - *Why it matters:* Real-time vs. snapshot costing

**Q5.4: Shipping/Freight Allocation**

- How should PO shipping costs be allocated?
  - Evenly across all line items? By weight? By value?
  - Added to material cost or tracked separately?
  - *Why it matters:* Landed cost calculation
  - Shipping costs will be allocated evenly across all line items on the PO and added to the material cost for accurate COGS calculation.

**Q5.5: Waste Cost Allocation**

- When materials are wasted, how is the cost handled?
  - Absorbed into remaining inventory? Separate expense category?
  - *Why it matters:* Financial reporting accuracy
  - Wasted materials should be tracked separately to provide visibility into production inefficiencies and inform future process improvements.
---

## 6. Purchase Order Workflow

### Context

POs are primarily for cost tracking and inventory addition, not complex procurement workflows.

### Questions

**Q6.1: PO Creation Timing**

- Are POs created before or after materials are ordered?
  - Before (planning)? After (recording what was ordered)? Both?
  - *Why it matters:* Affects required vs. optional fields
  - POs will typically be created before ordering to plan purchases, but the system will allow creation after the fact to record what was actually ordered.

**Q6.2: Receiving Process**

- What happens when materials arrive?
  - Users mark PO as received? Create separate receiving record?
  - Do they inspect/verify quantities before accepting?
  - *Why it matters:* Receiving workflow design
    - Upon material arrival, users will mark the PO as received and enter the actual quantities received. There will be an option to note discrepancies between ordered and received quantities, but no separate receiving record will be created.

**Q6.3: Price Discrepancies**

- How common are price differences between PO and actual invoice?
  - How do users want to handle this? Update PO? Track variance?
  - *Why it matters:* Cost reconciliation features
    - Price discrepancies will be relatively rare. When they occur, users will update the PO to reflect the actual price paid, and the system will track the variance for reporting purposes.

**Q6.4: Partial Shipments**

- How often are POs delivered in multiple shipments?
  - Common? Rare?
  - *Why it matters:* Multi-receive workflow complexity
    - This will be relatively rare, and the system will not support multi-receive workflows initially.

**Q6.5: PO Status Transitions**

- What status workflow makes sense for your process?
  - Draft → Ordered → Received → Closed?
  - Can users skip statuses (e.g., straight from Draft to Received)?
  - *Why it matters:* Status field design and validation
 -   The PO status workflow will be Draft → Ordered → Received → Closed. Users can skip the Ordered status if they create the PO after the fact, going directly from Draft to Received.
---

## 7. Unit Conversion System

### Context

Suppliers may sell in different units than internal usage (e.g., lbs vs. grams).

### Questions

**Q7.1: Conversion Scenarios**

- What are the most common unit conversions needed?
  - Imperial ↔ Metric (lbs/kg, oz/g)?
  - Volume conversions (gallons/liters)?
  - Count-based (dozen, cases, pallets → units)?
  - *Why it matters:* Determines which conversions to support
  - most conversions will be from like unit types, e.g. kg to g, lbs to oz, liters to ml, etc.

**Q7.2: Conversion Storage**

- Should the system store materials in:
  - Supplier's unit and convert on usage?
  - Always convert to standard unit on receipt?
  - Store both and let user choose?
  - *Why it matters:* Database design and display logic
    - The system will store a standard internal unit for each material (e.g., grams for weight-based materials) and convert supplier units to this standard upon receipt. This ensures consistency in inventory tracking and cost calculations.

**Q7.3: Recipe Units**

- What units do BOMs typically use?
  - Same as inventory units? Or different (e.g., "1 cup" vs "240ml")?
  - *Why it matters:* BOM entry UX
  - Most BOMs will use the same units as inventory, but there may be cases where recipe-specific units are needed (e.g., "1 cup" for liquid ingredients).
**Q7.4: Conversion Precision**

- How precise do conversions need to be?
  - Round to nearest gram? Or 0.01g?
  - *Why it matters:* Rounding errors in calculations
  - Precision to two decimal places will generally be sufficient for most materials.

**Q7.5: User Override**

- Should users be able to manually input conversion factors?
  - Or rely only on system-defined conversions?
  - *Why it matters:* Flexibility vs. consistency
    - Users will not be able to manually input conversion factors; the system will rely on predefined conversion tables to ensure consistency and accuracy.

## 9. User Roles & Permissions

### Context

System will have Admin, Manager, and Operator roles. Operators may have delete restrictions.

### Questions

**Q9.1: Role Distribution**

- In a typical small manufacturer, how many users per role?
  - 1 Admin, 2 Managers, 5 Operators? Different ratio?
  - *Why it matters:* UI optimization for most common role
    - A typical small manufacturer might have 1 Admin, 1-2 Managers, and 3-5 Operators. The UI will be optimized to accommodate this distribution, ensuring that the most common tasks for each role are easily accessible.

**Q9.2: Operator Restrictions**

- What specifically should Operators NOT be able to do?
  - Delete records? Edit costs? View financial reports?
  - *Why it matters:* Permission matrix design
    - Operators will not be able to delete records or view financial reports. They will have permissions to edit production data but not cost-related information.

**Q9.3: Manager Capabilities**

- What's the key difference between Manager and Admin?
  - Managers can't invite users? Can't change settings?
  - *Why it matters:* Permission boundaries
    - Managers will not have the ability to invite new users or change organization-wide settings. Their permissions will focus on overseeing production and inventory management.

**Q9.4: Cross-Organization Users**

- How common is it for one person to work with multiple orgs?
  - Consultant? Multi-location owner? Rare?
  - *Why it matters:* Org switcher prominence in UI
  - The org switcher will be placed in the top right corner of the ui in the header, near the logout button. This will make it easily accessible for users who need to switch between organizations frequently.

**Q9.5: Permission Violations**

- What happens when user tries unauthorized action?
  - Hide button? Show button but error on click? Request approval?
  - *Why it matters:* Error handling and UX
    - Unauthorized actions will be handled by hiding the relevant buttons or options in the UI to prevent confusion. If a user attempts to access a restricted area, a clear error message will be displayed explaining the lack of permissions.
---

## 10. Multi-Stage Production

### Context

System will support multi-stage production (e.g., production + packaging) but not nested BOMs.

### Questions

**Q10.1: Stage Definition**

- What defines a "stage" in production?
  - Different location? Different labor type? Time gap?
  - *Why it matters:* How to model stages in database
  - A stage is typically defined by a distinct phase in the production process that may involve different locations, equipment, or labor types. Time gaps between stages can also be a factor, but the primary definition will focus on the operational differences. e.g. Kitchen, Cooling, Packaging, etc.

**Q10.2: Stage Dependencies**

- Must Stage 1 be completed before Stage 2 starts?
  - Or can they overlap?
  - *Why it matters:* Workflow validation rules
  - No overlap is allowed; each stage must be completed before the next begins to ensure accurate tracking and costing.

**Q10.3: Cost Allocation by Stage**

- Do users care about cost per stage?
  - Or just total production cost?
  - *Why it matters:* Whether to track stage costs separately
    - Users will primarily care about total production cost, but the system will track costs by stage to provide detailed insights and support process improvements.

**Q10.4: Common Stage Patterns**

- What are the typical production stages?
  - Mixing → Packaging? Cooking → Cooling → Packaging?
  - *Why it matters:* Could provide stage templates

**Q10.5: Stage Inventory**

- Does inventory move between stages?
  - Or is it consumed in Stage 1 and created in final stage?
  - *Why it matters:* Inventory transaction design
    - Inventory is consumed in the initial stage and the finished product is created in the final stage. There is no intermediate inventory between stages.

## 12. Settings & Configuration

### Context

Single currency and costing method per org. Users can belong to multiple orgs with switcher.

### Questions

**Q12.1: Organization Creation**

- When do new organizations get created in the system?
  - At signup? By existing admin? Super admin only?
  - *Why it matters:* Onboarding flow design
  - A fresh user that signs up will be pushed to a landing page that prompts them to either create a new organization or join an existing one via an invite link. They will not be able to proceed without selecting one of these options.

**Q12.2: Initial Setup**

- What settings must be configured before first use?
  - Currency? Overhead rate? Fiscal year? All optional?
  - *Why it matters:* Setup wizard vs. optional settings
    - Upon creating a new organization, users will be guided through a setup wizard that prompts them to configure essential settings such as currency and overhead rate. Other settings will be optional and can be adjusted later.

**Q12.3: Setting Change Frequency**

- How often do you expect to change core settings?
  - Never? Annually? Monthly?
  - *Why it matters:* Whether to add change warnings/locks
    - Core settings will typically be set during the initial setup and may only be changed infrequently, such as annually or when there are significant business changes. The system will include warnings when changing critical settings to prevent accidental modifications.

**Q12.4: Default Values**

- What sensible defaults should we provide?
  - Default currency USD? Default units? Default overhead rate?
  - *Why it matters:* Reduces setup friction
    - The system will default to USD as the currency and provide common units of measurement based on the selected industry. A default overhead rate of 20% will be suggested, but users can adjust this during setup.

**Q12.5: Organization Naming**

- How do users identify organizations?
  - Company name? Location? Brand? Project?
  - *Why it matters:* Org switcher display
    - Organizations will typically be identified by the company name, which will be prominently displayed in the org switcher for easy recognition.
---

## 13. Empty States & First-Time Experience

### Context

New users will have no data. Need helpful empty states and possibly sample data.

### Questions

**Q13.1: Sample Data Preference**

- Would sample/demo data be helpful for new users?
  - Or prefer starting with blank slate?
  - *Why it matters:* Whether to build demo data generator
 - New users will prefer starting with a blank slate to ensure that all data entered is relevant to their specific operations. However, the system will provide tooltips and guidance throughout the onboarding process to help users understand how to set up their data effectively.

**Q13.2: Learning Style**

- How do users prefer to learn new software?
  - Video tutorials? Written guides? Just explore? Talk to support?
  - *Why it matters:* In-app help design
  - Complex tasks and settings should have a "Learn More" link that opens a relevant help doc in a new tab. This allows users to explore the software at their own pace while having access to detailed guidance when needed. Otherwise the system will rely on intuitive design and tooltips for basic onboarding, rather than extensive tutorials. This is the kind of software that users will book training sessions for, rather than expecting to learn it all on their own.

**Q13.3: Critical First Steps**

- What's the minimum data needed to get value from the system?
  - Add materials → Create PO → Record production? Different order?
  - *Why it matters:* Onboarding checklist design

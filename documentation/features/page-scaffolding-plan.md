# Page Scaffolding Plan - Pulse COGS Platform

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** Planning  
**Phase:** Initial Scaffolding

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to scaffold the core pages of the Pulse COGS manufacturing cost management platform. The goal is to create working page templates with mock data that demonstrate functionality before implementing full backend integration.

## Guiding Principles

- **Start Simple:** Build basic, working interfaces first
- **Mock Data First:** Use realistic sample data to validate UX before API integration
- **Consistent Patterns:** Establish reusable components and layouts
- **Authentication Required:** All feature pages require logged-in users
- **Mobile-First:** Responsive design for shop floor and office use

## 1. Inventory Management Page

**Route:** `/inventory`  
**File:** `app/inventory/page.tsx`

### Purpose

Provide a high-level overview of all inventory items - both raw materials and finished goods - with filtering and basic CRUD operations.

### Key Features

- Data table with sortable columns (SKU, name, type, quantity, value)
- Filters: Item type (raw/finished), low stock alerts, category
- Search functionality
- Add New Item button â†’ opens dialog/form
- Row actions: View details, Edit, Delete
- Stock level indicators (adequate, low, critical)
- Total inventory value summary card

### Mock Data Structure

```typescript
interface InventoryItem {
  id: string
  sku: string
  name: string
  type: 'raw_material' | 'finished_good'
  category: string
  quantity: number
  unit: string
  unitCost: number
  totalValue: number
  reorderPoint: number
  supplier?: string
  lastUpdated: Date
}
```

### Questions & Implications

**Business Logic Questions:**

- Should we show mixed raw materials and finished goods in one table, or separate tabs?
  - *Implication:* Affects filtering complexity and user mental model
  - I think we should separate them into tabs for clarity and user experience. The production tab will focus on creating finished goods from raw materials via a bill of materials to assign production usage and goods tracking. The raw materials page will be mostly for viewing stock levels and managing items that are inputs for production.
- What units of measure do we support (kg, lbs, units, liters)?
  - *Implication:* Needs unit conversion logic or standardization
  - The system should support common manufacturing units like kg, lbs, liters, and pieces. We may need a unit conversion utility to handle different supplier units versus internal usage. For example, a supplier may sell sugar in lbs but we use grams when creating production runs.
- How do we handle multi-location inventory tracking?
  - *Implication:* May need location column and filtering
  - There will be no multi-location tracking, that is completely out of scope.
- Should quantity be editable directly in table or require adjustment transactions?
  - *Implication:* Affects audit trail and data integrity
  - quantity should only be editable via adjustment transactions to maintain a proper audit trail and maintain cost records for calculating COGS.

**Technical Questions:**

- What's the expected scale? (100 items vs 10,000 items)
  - *Implication:* May need pagination, virtual scrolling, or different data fetching strategy
  - The program is currently aimed at small-to-medium manufacturers, so we expect inventory items to be in the range of 100-1,000 initially. Keep scalability in mind, but do not over-engineer for massive scale.
- Should we use optimistic updates when editing quantities?
  - *Implication:* Affects user experience but adds complexity
  - Optimistic updates are completely out of scope for now.
- How do we handle concurrent edits by multiple users?
  - *Implication:* Need conflict resolution strategy
  - The system will check for the latest data version before allowing edits, prompting users to refresh if conflicts arise.

**UX Questions:**

- Do users need bulk import/export functionality immediately?
  - *Implication:* CSV upload feature may be critical for adoption
  - Bulk import/export is out of scope for the initial version.
- Should we show historical quantity changes on this page?
  - *Implication:* May need expandable rows or separate history view
  - Yes, showing historical changes can help users understand inventory trends and make informed decisions.
- What's the most common user workflow - adding items or viewing current stock?
  - *Implication:* Affects primary action placement and default view
  - The user workflow will primarily focus on inputting data for analysis. Most of the production tracking is likely going to be done after the production has already completed, so focus on easy data entry and review. Make sure that the CRUD actions are intuitive and accessible.

## 2. Raw Materials Tracking Page

**Route:** `/raw-materials`  
**File:** `app/raw-materials/page.tsx`

### Purpose

Detailed tracking of raw materials with lot/batch management, supplier relationships, and usage analytics specifically for manufacturing inputs.

### Key Features

- Detailed material cards/table with expanded information
- Lot/batch tracking with expiration dates (for perishables)
- Supplier information and alternate suppliers
- Reorder point alerts and recommendations
- Material usage history (which production runs consumed it)
- Cost trends chart showing price changes over time
- Quick actions: Record receipt, Adjust quantity, Create PO

### Mock Data Structure

```typescript
interface RawMaterial {
  id: string
  sku: string
  name: string
  category: string
  currentStock: number
  unit: string
  reorderPoint: number
  reorderQuantity: number
  primarySupplier: {
    id: string
    name: string
    leadTime: number // days
    lastPrice: number
  }
  alternateSuppliers: Supplier[]
  lots: {
    lotNumber: string
    quantity: number
    receivedDate: Date
    expirationDate?: Date
    cost: number
  }[]
  usageHistory: {
    date: Date
    quantity: number
    productionRunId: string
    cost: number
  }[]
  priceHistory: {
    date: Date
    price: number
    supplierId: string
  }[]
}
```

### Questions & Implications

**Business Logic Questions:**

- Do we enforce FIFO (First In First Out) consumption of lots?
  - *Implication:* Requires automatic lot selection logic in production
  - No, allow the user to input whatever lot they want to consume. Most of the data is likely going to be input after-the-fact, so strict FIFO enforcement is not necessary. Prioritize allowing the user to accurately reflect what actually happened on the production floor.
- How do we handle partial lot consumption and remnants?
  - *Implication:* Affects inventory accuracy and waste tracking
  - Track the remaining quantity in each lot after consumption to maintain accurate inventory levels. Include a history of lot consumption for audit purposes. Allow users to designate waste from lots.
- Should reorder points be calculated automatically based on usage patterns?
  - *Implication:* Needs consumption analytics and forecasting logic
  - No, this is out of scope for now.
- Do materials have shelf life/expiration that affects valuation?
  - *Implication:* May need expiration alerts and write-off processes
  - No, this is out of scope for now.

**Compliance & Traceability:**

- Are lot numbers required for regulatory compliance?
  - *Implication:* Makes lot tracking mandatory, not optional
  - Implement lot numbers for all raw materials to ensure traceability and compliance with industry standards.
- How long must we retain lot traceability records?
  - *Implication:* Affects data retention and archival strategy
  - Out of scope for now.
- Do we need to track material origin (country, farm, facility)?
  - *Implication:* Extended supplier data and compliance reporting
  - No, this is out of scope for now.

**Technical Questions:**

- How do we handle materials received in different units than used?
  - *Implication:* Need unit conversion system (received in pallets, used in kg)
    - The system should support common manufacturing units like kg, lbs, liters, and pieces. We may need a unit conversion utility to handle different supplier units versus internal usage. For example, a supplier may sell sugar in lbs but we use grams when creating production runs.
- Should we support composite materials (premixed/pre-processed)?
  - *Implication:* Materials that are themselves products of production runs
  - Out of scope, the user should be able to define multiple different BOMs that have different raw materials for usage.
- How do we link lot numbers across the supply chain?
  - The system will assign an internal lot number for each receipt of raw materials and track the linkage and usage of raw materials throughout the production process. Tracking outside of our system is out of scope.

**UX Questions:**

- Should lot selection be manual or automatic during production?
  - *Implication:* Balance between control and automation
  - Lot selection should be a searchable dropdown to allow users to pick a lot or input their own lot number if needed.
- Do users need mobile access for receiving materials on warehouse floor?
  - *Implication:* Mobile-optimized receiving workflow needed
  - The program should be generally mobile responsive with a modern design, but a dedicated mobile functionality is out of scope.
- How prominently should we display low stock alerts?
  - *Implication:* May need dashboard widget or notification system
  - Display low stock alerts on the inventory dashboard and within the raw materials page itself, using color-coded indicators to draw attention to critical items.

## 3. Production Management Page

**Route:** `/production`  
**File:** `app/production/page.tsx`

### Purpose

Track production runs, manage Bills of Materials (BOMs), calculate production costs, and monitor manufacturing efficiency.

### Key Features

- Tabs: Active Runs | Completed Runs | BOMs
- Active runs list with progress indicators
- BOM viewer with nested components and cost rollup
- Start New Production Run form
- Cost calculation breakdown (materials + labor + overhead)
- Actual vs. Estimated cost comparison
- Material consumption tracking
- Production efficiency metrics (cycle time, yield %)
- Production run details view with edit capability

### Mock Data Structure

```typescript
interface ProductionRun {
  id: string
  runNumber: string
  productId: string
  productName: string
  quantityPlanned: number
  quantityProduced: number
  status: 'planned' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'cancelled'
  startDate: Date
  completedDate?: Date
  bomId: string
  estimatedCost: number
  actualCost: number
  materialCosts: MaterialConsumption[]
  laborHours: number
  laborCost: number
  overheadCost: number
  notes: string
}

interface BillOfMaterials {

    totalCost: number
  }[]
  totalMaterialCost: number
  estimatedLaborHours: number
  estimatedLaborCost: number
  overheadRate: number
  totalEstimatedCost: number
}
```

### Questions & Implications

**Business Logic Questions:**

- How do we handle BOM versioning when recipes change?
  - *Implication:* Need to track which BOM version was used for each run
  - Each production batch and item will have a raw materials usage history tied to it. The BOM just defines the standard recipe, but the actual history of what was used is what matters for cost tracking. The BOM will have versioning to allow users to update recipes over time, but historical runs will always reference the actual raw materials used.
- What happens when actual material usage differs from BOM?
  - *Implication:* Variance reporting and investigation workflow
  - The goal of the system is not to enforce regulatory compliance, so all fields should be editable after-the-fact to reflect what actually happened on the production floor. Implement a variance report to allow the user to note errors or discrepancies, but do not enforce strict adherence to the BOM.
- Should we support multi-level BOMs (sub-assemblies)?
  - *Implication:* Complex cost rollup and nested material tracking
  - Out of scope for now. We will allow users to have multi-stage production runs, e.g. production and packaging but not nested BOMs.
- How do we calculate overhead allocation (per unit, per run, per time)?
  - *Implication:* Affects cost accuracy and requires configuration
  - Overhead will be a configurable rate applied per production run based on estimated labor hours. This simplifies calculations while still providing a reasonable allocation method.

**Production Planning:**

- Do we need production scheduling and capacity planning?
  - *Implication:* Much more complex feature set
    - Out of scope for now.
- Should we support batch production with multiple recipes?
  - *Implication:* Co-product and by-product tracking
  - Out of scope for now.
- How do we handle scrap, waste, and rework?
  - *Implication:* Separate cost categories and yield calculations
  - Out of scope for now. Implement a rework feature that allows users to manually allocate more raw materials and labor to a production run if needed.
- Can production runs be paused and resumed?
  - *Implication:* State management and partial costing
    - Out of scope for now. Only track planned, in-progress, and completed states. Labor and time recording will be manually input.

**Cost Accounting:**

- What costing method do we use (Standard, Actual, Average)?
  - *Implication:* Fundamental impact on cost calculations
  - Start with Actual costing to reflect real usage and costs. Standard costing can be considered for future versions, but is out of scope for now.
- How do we handle work-in-progress (WIP) inventory?
  - *Implication:* Need to track partially completed production
  - Track the raw materials that are tied up in a WIP production run as "committed" inventory until the run is completed or cancelled, to avoid using materials that are already allocated to production.
- Should labor costs be tracked per operation or per run?
  - *Implication:* Granularity of time tracking required
    - Labor costs will be tracked per production run to simplify data entry and focus on overall production efficiency rather than micro-managing individual operations.
- How do we allocate shared resources across multiple runs?
  - *Implication:* Complex overhead allocation logic
  - The program will not track shared resources in detail. Overhead will be a flat rate applied per run based on estimated labor hours.

**Technical Questions:**

- How do we ensure atomic material consumption (all or nothing)?
  - *Implication:* Transaction management and rollback capability
  - Implement transaction management to ensure that material consumption is only recorded if the entire production run is successfully started or completed. If any part fails, roll back all changes to maintain data integrity, if material is consumed but the run fails, the user should be able to manually adjust raw materials or inventory as waste.
- Should production runs automatically create inventory transactions?
  - *Implication:* Tight coupling between production and inventory modules
  Yes, starting a production run should reserve the necessary raw materials in inventory, and completing the run should deduct the consumed materials and add the finished goods to inventory. The complete run dialog will show the user what materials will be consumed and allow them to adjust if needed.
- How do we handle real-time cost updates during a run?
  - *Implication:* WebSocket or polling for live updates
  - Real-time updates are out of scope for now. Cost calculations will be done at the start and completion of the run, with manual adjustments allowed if needed.

**UX Questions:**

- Should operators be able to start/stop runs from mobile devices?
  - *Implication:* Shop floor usability considerations.
    - The program should be generally mobile responsive with a modern design, but a dedicated mobile functionality is out of scope.
- Do we need barcode/QR scanning for material consumption?
  - *Implication:* Integration with scanning hardware
    - Out of scope for now.
- How detailed should progress tracking be (percentage, stages, operations)?
  - *Implication:* Affects data entry burden on operators
    - Track progress at a high level (planned, in-progress, completed) to minimize data entry burden. Detailed operation tracking is out of scope for now.

    - Material costs, labor costs, overhead costs, cost per unit, inventory turnover, production efficiency
- How do we calculate Cost of Goods Sold accurately?
  - *Implication:* Proper cost accounting methodology
  - COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory + Direct Labor + Overhead
  - Calculate COGS on a per-production-run basis to ensure accuracy. Each item produced will have its own COGS based on the actual raw materials, labor, and overhead allocated to that specific run, which will enable precise profit margin analysis by product.
- Should we track contribution margin by product/customer?
  - *Implication:* Additional revenue data required
    - Out of scope for now.
- Do we need industry benchmark comparisons?
  - *Implication:* External data sources and anonymized aggregation
    - Out of scope for now.

**Data Visualization:**

- Should reports be shareable with stakeholders?
  - *Implication:* Public links or email scheduling
    - Out of scope for now.

**Technical Questions:**

- How do we handle large datasets for reporting?
  - *Implication:* Data warehousing or aggregation tables
    - Use aggregation tables and background jobs to pre-calculate common metrics for performance. Avoid real-time calculations on large datasets. Only implement real-time data fetching for small datasets or summary metrics, not detailed reports. Do not over-engineer for massive scale until performance issues arise.
- Should we pre-calculate common metrics?
  - *Implication:* Background jobs and materialized views
    - Yes, pre-calculate common metrics nightly to ensure fast report loading times.
- Do we need to support data exports for external analysis?
  - *Implication:* CSV, Excel, API access for BI tools
  - Data export as csv is a must-have feature. More export formats can be considered later.
- How do we ensure report performance with growing data?
  - *Implication:* Query optimization and caching strategies
  - Use indexing, query optimization, and caching strategies to maintain performance as data grows. Monitor performance and adjust as needed.

**Business Intelligence:**

- Should we integrate with existing BI tools (Tableau, Power BI)?
  - *Implication:* API design for third-party access
  - Out of scope for now.
- Do we need predictive analytics (forecasting, anomaly detection)?
  - *Implication:* Machine learning integration
  - Out of scope for now, plan for simple analytics only at first, then consider more advanced features later.

### Questions & Implications

**Multi-Tenancy:**

- How do we ensure data isolation between organizations?
  - *Implication:* Database design with org_id filtering everywhere
  - Organizations will be completely isolated from each other. A user that belongs to multiple organizations will be presented with a switcher at login to select which organization they want to work in, but the routes and data will always be scoped to the selected organization.
- Can users belong to multiple organizations?
  - *Implication:* Organization switching and context management
    - Yes, a user can belong to multiple organizations. Implement an organization switcher in the UI to allow users to select which organization they want to work in during their session.
- Should we support org-to-org data sharing?
  - *Implication:* Complex permissions and data visibility rules
  - No, out of scope, each organization is completely isolated.
- How do we handle organization deletion?
  - *Implication:* Data retention policies and soft deletion
    - Implement soft deletion for organizations to allow recovery within a certain time frame. Ensure that all associated data is also marked as deleted but retained for audit purposes.

**User Management:**

- What roles and permissions do we need?
  - *Implication:* RBAC system design and enforcement
  - Keep simple roles: Admin (full access), Manager (most access), Operator (limited access, delete can be restricted).

  - *Implication:* Exchange rate management and reporting complexity
  - Out of scope for now, only support a single currency per organization.
- Should we support multiple currencies in one organization?
  - *Implication:* Complex currency conversion throughout app
    - Out of scope for now, only support a single currency per organization.
- How do we handle changes to default units of measure?
  - *Implication:* Potential data inconsistency
  - Make sure that all calculations and reports are correctly accounting for the current unit of measure. e.g. 1L = 1000mL, taking 800ml from inventory should reduce 0.8L if the default unit is L.
- Can users customize which features are enabled?
  - *Implication:* Feature flags and conditional rendering
    - Out of scope for now.

**Integration Strategy:**

- Which integrations are highest priority?
